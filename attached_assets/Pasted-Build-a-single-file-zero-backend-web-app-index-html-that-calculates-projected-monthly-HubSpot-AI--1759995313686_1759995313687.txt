Build a single-file, zero-backend web app (index.html) that calculates projected monthly HubSpot AI credit usage and cost. Use vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks, no build step). Keep code clean and well-commented.

1) Brand & Tone (OneMetric.io)

Visual: minimal, enterprise-clean. Neutral light background, strong typographic hierarchy, rounded cards, subtle shadows.

Header at top-left: OneMetric.io (as a text logo). Tagline under it: “HubSpot AI Credits—clear, predictable, no surprises.”

Microcopy tone: concise, no fluff, ROI-oriented.

Footer badge: “Built by OneMetric.io”.

2) Data model (from the attached sheet)

Embed this JSON constant directly in the JS (no network calls): it lists features, categories, and rates.

};

3) UI

Left panel: Plan Setup

Select highest owned tier among Smart CRM/Marketing/Sales/Service/Content Hub: radio (Starter / Professional / Enterprise). Show included credits (500 / 3000 / 5000).

Select Data Hub / Customer Platform tier: radio (None / Starter 500 / Pro 5000 / Enterprise 10000). This adds to included credits.

Small note: “Smart CRM/Marketing/Sales/Service/Content Hub uses highest tier only. Data Hub adds on top.”

Center panel: Usage Inputs

Group inputs by category from actions. For each actionable item where credits_per_unit is a number, render a number input (min 0, step 1). Show “× {credits_per_unit} credits” and a subtle help icon to display notes. Default all to 0.

For items with credits_per_unit: null (TBD), render as disabled rows with a “TBD (Beta)” badge.

Right panel (sticky): Summary

Included credits (sum of selected tiers).

Projected usage (sum of all inputs × per-unit credits).

Net balance (included – used). If negative, show deficit in red.

Expansion options when deficit > 0:

Capacity packs: packs_needed = Math.ceil(deficit / 1000), cost = packs_needed * 10.

Overage: overage is $0.010 per credit with minimum 10-credit increments. Compute as: Math.ceil(deficit / 10) * 0.10.

Show both options; highlight the cheaper one as “Recommended” with a badge.

Utility:

“Reset” button.

“Export CSV” (download rows: feature, count, per-unit credits, subtotal, totals).

“Share” button that encodes state in the URL hash (base64 JSON). On load, parse hash to restore state.

4) Calculation rules

Included credits = (highest of Smart CRM/Marketing/Sales/Service/Content Hub tiers) + (selected Data Hub tier; 0 if “None”).

Usage = Σ (input_count × credits_per_unit) across actionable rows.

Net = included – usage.

If deficit > 0:

Capacity packs: packs = ceil(deficit / 1000); pack credits = packs*1000; pack cost = $10 * packs.

Overage: cost = ceil(deficit / 10) * $0.10 (10-credit minimum, then charged per 10-credit block).

Show both and mark the lower cost as Recommended. Also show the effective total credits after packs, and the new net.

All currency display in USD. Use thousands separators for numbers.

5) UX polish

Accessible number steppers, mobile-first layout, sticky summary on desktop.

Tooltips for notes.

Empty-state copy in center panel: “Estimate counts for this month. Adjust anytime.”

Toast after export/share.

6) Sample copy (use as placeholders)

Section titles:

Plan Setup → “Your HubSpot plan”

Usage Inputs → “Estimate your month”

Summary → “Projection”

Taglines/snippets:

“No surprises. Model usage before you spend.”

“Clear math. Actionable choices.”

Button labels: “Reset”, “Export CSV”, “Share”.

7) Testing hooks

Provide a small window.__test__ object with functions returning current state and totals so we can assert calculations in console.

Deliverable: A single index.html that runs locally and on Replit Static Web Server. No external dependencies.

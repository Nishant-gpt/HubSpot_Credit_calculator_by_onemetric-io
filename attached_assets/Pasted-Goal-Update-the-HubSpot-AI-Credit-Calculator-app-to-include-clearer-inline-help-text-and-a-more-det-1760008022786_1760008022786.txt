Goal:
Update the HubSpot AI Credit Calculator app to include clearer inline help text and a more detailed Prospecting Agent calculation.
All help text should be visible directly under input fields ‚Äî not hidden behind info icons or hover states.

‚ú≥Ô∏è Updates Required
üß© 1. Customer Agent Calculation Section

Change:
Add visible help text below the input field for the Customer Agent.

New Help Text:

‚ÄúEstimate how many tickets or conversations each customer support agent is expected to handle per month. This helps calculate the AI cost per agent based on real workload.‚Äù

Implementation:

Display this text below or next to the label ‚ÄúCustomer Agent Calculation‚Äù (e.g., inside a <p> tag styled as small, muted text: text-sm text-gray-500 mt-1).

Ensure the field still accepts numeric input for monthly tickets/conversations.

üß© 2. Prospecting Agent (Monitor Contact) Section

Change:
Add two new input fields under the Prospecting Agent section, both required for calculation logic.

New Inputs:

Meetings or Demos Needed per Month ‚Üí numeric field

Expected Conversion Rate (%) ‚Üí numeric field (between 1‚Äì100)

New Help Text (visible under each):

For Meetings or Demos Needed:

‚ÄúHow many qualified meetings or demos do you expect your prospecting agent to book per month?‚Äù

For Conversion Rate (%):

‚ÄúWhat is your expected conversion rate from outreach to booked meetings? (e.g., 5%, 10%, 20%)‚Äù

New Calculation Logic:
Add a derived field (auto-calculated, read-only) for:

Contacts to Monitor = Meetings or Demos Needed √∑ (Conversion Rate / 100)

Display the result dynamically in the Prospecting Agent section under the new fields:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll need to monitor approximately X contacts per month.‚Äù

Example:
If user enters

Meetings = 20

Conversion = 5%
‚Üí Display ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll need to monitor approximately 400 contacts per month.‚Äù

üß© 3. UI & Style

Use the same card or section layout style already present in the app (Tailwind + shadcn).

Help texts should be always visible (no tooltips/icons). Use small muted text style.

Align new fields neatly under the Prospecting Agent section title.

The dynamic calculated ‚Äúcontacts to monitor‚Äù value should be styled as subtle emphasized text ‚Äî e.g., text-md font-semibold text-purple-600 mt-2.

üß© 4. Validation

Meetings and conversion fields should both be required numeric values.

Conversion rate must be between 1 and 100.

Show a soft validation message if values are missing or out of range.

üß© 5. Example Layout (for clarity)
üß† Prospecting Agent (Monitor Contact)

[Meetings or Demos Needed per Month] [input]
How many qualified meetings or demos do you expect your prospecting agent to book per month?

[Expected Conversion Rate (%)] [input]
What is your expected conversion rate from outreach to booked meetings? (e.g., 5%, 10%, 20%)

‚û°Ô∏è You‚Äôll need to monitor approximately 400 contacts per month.

üß© 6. Optional Enhancement (if easy)

Add a small ‚ÄúReset Values‚Äù button at the bottom of the form to clear all inputs.

‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

All help texts are always visible (no hover tooltips).

Prospecting Agent section now includes new inputs + calculated contacts.

Calculations update dynamically as user types.

All layout, colors, and spacing remain consistent with current design.

üß† Developer Note

If the app is using React with Tailwind (likely), locate the component handling these inputs (probably CustomerAgentCard and ProspectingAgentCard) and modify:

useState hooks for new fields.

Add a derived state:

const contactsToMonitor = conversionRate > 0 
  ? Math.round(meetingsNeeded / (conversionRate / 100))
  : 0;


Display that value below inputs.

Now implement all of the above and redeploy the updated calculator.

Refactor the existing HubSpot AI Credits Calculator at my current URL into a single-file static app (index.html) with:

A. Hero + collapsing header

Full-width Hero with:
Left: “Breeze by OneMetric.io” (text logo).
Center: H1 “HubSpot Credits Calculator” + sub “Estimate your monthly credit consumption.”
Right: a 3-stat KPI card (“Included”, “Projected”, “Net”).

On scroll, collapse to a sticky top bar showing the 3 KPIs and a “Talk to an expert” mailto button.

B. Three-column layout

Left: Steps (unchanged order).

Center: current step’s inputs.

Right: Partner Talk-Track panel with these sections and sample copy (use placeholders I provide below):

“Primary question”

“If they don’t know”

“Common benchmark”

“Formula” (plain English)

“Example” (one example row)
The talk-track panel must update when the step changes. No tooltips; show text inline.

C. Feature logic (keep existing math; add Goal Mode where specified)

Implement/adjust:

Customer Agent: input “Conversations/month”; credits = conversations × 100.
Talk-track: Primary → “How many conversations across all channels per month?” Include chat, email, social, other text.

Prospecting Agent (Monitor Contact): add a two-tab input:

Direct: companies/month (default contactsPerCompany=2; editable). credits = companies × contactsPerCompany × 100.

Goal mode: inputs: meetingsNeeded, meetingConversion% (0–100, step 1), contactsPerCompany (default 2). Derived companies = ceil(meetingsNeeded / (meetingConversion%/100)). Credits = companies × contactsPerCompany × 100.
Show helper lines: “Don’t know? Reps × accounts/rep/month” and a benchmark chip: “50–100 accounts/rep/month.”

Prospecting Agent (Company Research): input “Research results/month”; credits = results × 10.

Data Agent: inputs: questionsCount × newRecordsPerMonth × refreshesPerMonth (presets: 1, 4, 30). Credits = product × 10.

Breeze Workflows: input “AI actions executed/month”; credits = actions × 10.

Buyer Intent: inputs: targetAccounts + additionalCompanies; credits = (sum) × 10.

Data Hub: inputs: datasetSize (Small 25 / Medium 75 / Large 200), destinations, syncFrequency (One-time 1, Monthly 1, Daily 30, Hourly 700, Fifteen-min 2900). Credits = sizeCredits × destinations × frequency.

D. Summary block

Show Included, Projected, Net. If deficit > 0, compute:

Capacity packs: ceil(deficit / 1000) × $10.

Overage: ceil(deficit / 10) × $0.10.
Highlight cheaper as “Recommended”. Add a mini line: “Capacity packs suit consistent overages; overage is fine for spikes.”

E. Copy to insert in the Talk-Track panel (per step)

Customer Agent
Primary: “How many conversations across all channels per month?”
Alternatives: “If unsure, last month’s chat + email + social thread counts work.”
Benchmark: “Early teams often start 200–1,000/month.”
Formula: conversations × 100 credits.
Example: “1,000 conversations × 100 = 100,000 credits.”

Prospecting Agent (Monitor Contact)
Primary: “How many companies do you want to prospect into each month?”
Alternatives: “How many reps? How many accounts per rep per month?”
Benchmark: “50–100 accounts per rep per month.”
Formula: companies × contacts/company × 100 (default contacts/company = 2).
Example: “375 companies × 200 = 75,000 credits.”

Prospecting Agent (Company Research)
Primary: “How many deep research results do you need per month?”
Formula: results × 10.
Example: “500 results × 10 = 5,000 credits.”

Data Agent
Primary: “How many custom questions do you answer per record?”
Alternatives: “How many new records per month? How often do you refresh?”
Formula: questions × new records × monthly refreshes × 10.
Example: “3 × 1,000 × 1 × 10 = 30,000 credits.”

Breeze Workflows
Primary: “What AI action and how many records per month?”
Formula: actions/month × 10.
Example: “200 actions × 10 = 2,000 credits.”

Buyer Intent
Primary: “How many target accounts do you want to actively track?”
Alternatives: “Any additional companies to monitor?”
Formula: (targets + others) × 10.
Example: “15 + 13 = 28 × 10 = 280 credits.”

Data Hub
Primary: “What’s your dataset size, destinations, and sync cadence?”
Formula: sizeCredits × destinations × syncs/month.
Example: “Medium (75) × 1 × 30 = 2,250 credits.”

F. Visuals + theming

Keep your current palette; apply to the new hero, KPI chips, and buttons. 20px rounded cards, soft shadow, subtle gradient hero.

Add quick-add chips (+50, +100, +1000) consistently to all numeric inputs.

G. Keep existing share/export behavior and IDs

Preserve URL state encoding, CSV export, and all calculation IDs. Only add the new controls and derived computations where specified.

Deliverable: one index.html (vanilla JS, CSS in a <style> block). No dependencies.

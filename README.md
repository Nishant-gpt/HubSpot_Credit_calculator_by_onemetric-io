💡 Why We Built This
At [OneMetric.io](https://www.onemetric.io), we work with CMOs, RevOps, and GTM teams to bring AI into everyday HubSpot workflows — from lead scoring and content creation to automated outreach and service resolution.
As early adopters of HubSpot AI and Breeze Agents, we wanted to make it easier for teams to plan usage, measure ROI, and discover where AI can create leverage.

This calculator started as an internal tool during our HubSpot AI enablement projects, and we’re open-sourcing it to help the community experiment and plan smarter.
